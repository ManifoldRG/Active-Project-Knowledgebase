# Satellite Autonomous Distributed Coordination
## Goal
The aim of this project is to facilitate the coordination of satellites for purposes including but not limited to: scientific missions, orbital construction, earth monitoring, space monitoring, etc.
This project is interdisciplinary, and will combine orbital mechanics and other environmental constraints with multi-agent coordination methods, such as reinforcement learning, stigmergy or a distributed command heirarchy.
## Status
Currently in survey stage, reviewing literature on multi-agent coordination methods as well as records of prior mission which have implemented some part of this goal. Following research survey, roadmap and first steps can be produced.
