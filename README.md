# Active-Projects-Knowledgebase

Notes and materials for Active Manifold Computing projects. 
This repo will contain the relevant reading material for the all active projects.

## Current Active Projects

1. DP-NAS: Applying different algortithms from differential privacy to architecture generation approaches. 
2. LSMN-Prototype: Initial empirical exploration and preliminary implementations of approaches to build LSMNs.
3. LSMN-Theory: Theoretical validation for Neural Composer, an initial general approach to the scalable generation of interpretable LSMNs. 
4. ML-for-Finance: Applying recent breakthroughs in Deep and Reinforcement Learning to problems in finance including equities prediction.
5. DP-Medical-Images: Applying different algorithms from differential privacy to medical image problems, serving as a useful benchmark for the community. 
6. Virtual-Green-Screen: Extending state of the art methods in background matting and other CV methods to build a better virtual greenscreen. 

## Organization overview

The folders are seperated based on topic.
Each topic will have relevant research papers and reading material.
Each paper will have a summary for quick reading.
